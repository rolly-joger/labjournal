End of stochastic approximation algorithm, phase 3.
---------------------------------------------------

Total of 2646 iterations.
Parameter estimates based on 1646 iterations,
basic rate parameter as well as 
convergence diagnostics, covariance and derivative matrices based on 1000 iterations.

Information for convergence diagnosis.
Averages, standard deviations, and t-ratios for deviations from targets:
Overall maximum t-ratio for convergence not computable.
  1.   26.1320  12.8532   2.0331 
  2. -171.4220 321.5757  -0.5331 
  3. -171.4220 321.5757  -0.5331 
  4.  -15.7970   5.3309  -2.9633 

Good convergence is indicated by the t-ratios being close to zero.

Overall maximum convergence ratio =  NA .
One or more of the t-statistics are rather large.
Convergence of the algorithm is doubtful.
*** Warning: Covariance matrix not positive definite *** 
***            Standard errors not reliable           *** 
The approximate linear combination that has variance 0 is
1 * beta[2] + -1 * beta[3]
Do not use any reported standard errors.

@3
Covariance matrices
                   
There is a linear dependency between the parameter estimates
 therefore the covariance matrix should not be used.
