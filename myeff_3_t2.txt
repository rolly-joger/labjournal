@1
Estimation by stochastic approximation algorithm.
=================================================

Random initialization of random number stream.
Current random number seed is 787172.
Effects object used: myeff_3 
Model Type:
 Initiative model 
Estimation method: conditional moment estimation.
Conditioning variable is the total number of observed changes ("distance") 
in the network variable.
Distance for simulations is  512 .
Standard errors are estimated with the likelihood ratio method.
Dolby method (regression on scores) is used.
Initial value of gain parameter is  0.2000000.
Reduction factor for gain parameter is  0.5000000.
Number of subphases in Phase 2 is 4.

Initial parameter values are 
  0. Rate parameter                           4.8092
  1. eval:  degree (density)                               -1.6016
  2. eval:  degree of alter                                 0.0000
  3. eval:  degree of ego                                   0.0000


Values of target statistics are
  1. Number of edges                                                    258.0000
  2. Sum of squared degrees                                            3408.0000
  3. Sum of squared degrees                                            3408.0000
These were calculated from the data.

 3 parameters, 3 statistics

Estimation of derivatives by the LR method (type 1).


@2
End of stochastic approximation algorithm, phase 3.
---------------------------------------------------

Total of 2294 iterations.
Parameter estimates based on 1294 iterations,
basic rate parameter as well as 
convergence diagnostics, covariance and derivative matrices based on 1000 iterations.

Information for convergence diagnosis.
Averages, standard deviations, and t-ratios for deviations from targets:
Overall maximum t-ratio for convergence not computable.
  1.  -1.0220  15.6124  -0.0655 
  2. 261.1600 734.7345   0.3554 
  3. 261.1600 734.7345   0.3554 

Good convergence is indicated by the t-ratios being close to zero.

Overall maximum convergence ratio =  NA .
One or more of the t-statistics are rather large.
*** Warning: Covariance matrix not positive definite *** 
***            Standard errors not reliable           *** 
The approximate linear combination that has variance 0 is
-1 * beta[2] + 1 * beta[3]
Do not use any reported standard errors.

Estimates and standard errors
                             
Rate parameters:
 0. Rate parameter                             9.149  (   1.0004)

Other parameters:
 1. eval:  degree (density)                                     NANA
 2. eval:  degree of alter                                      NANA
 3. eval:  degree of ego                                        NANA


@3
Covariance matrices
                   
There is a linear dependency between the parameter estimates
 therefore the covariance matrix should not be used.

Total computation time 95.14 seconds.
