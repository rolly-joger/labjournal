```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
 eval = F
)
```

```{r require, echo = F, include = F}
require(tidyverse)
require(igraph)
require(shiny)
require(RSiena)
require(rmdformats)
require(prettydoc)
require(hrbrthemes)
require(tint)
require(tufte)
require(psych)
```


```{r zachary}
library(igraph)
zach <- igraph::make_graph()
plot(zach)
```

```{r adjacency, include = F, echo = T}
zach_adjacent <- igraph::as_adjacency_matrix(zach, type = "both", sparse = F)
zach_adjacent
```

```{r descriptives}
vcount(zach)
igraph::ecount(zach)
igraph::degree(zach)
transitivity(zach, type = c("localundirected"), isolates = c("NaN", "zero"))
#igraph::betweenness(zach_adjacency)
```

```{r dyad and triad census}
igraph::dyad_census(zach) #mutual, asymetric, no relations between two vertices -- en als je 0 asymetrisch ziet, dan weet je undirected
#directed of undirected netwerk
#how is transitivity defined in een undirected netwerk
igraph::triad_census(zach)#so how are they "doin'"
#triad.census(zach_adjacent) #lovely
```

Now we calculate the global transitivity of the network. The formula to achieve this is:

```{r calculations }
transitivity(zach, type = "global")
a <- 1575
b <- 3*45 +393
b/a
```

## Adjusting the Graph

So, lets adjust the graph according to some aspects of the vertices included. 

```{r plot zach again}
V(zach)$size <-betweenness(zach, normalized = T, directed = F) * 60 + 10 #grote = *60, en de ander willen we wel zien, dus minimaal 10 (voor degene met 0)
igraph::plot.igraph(zach)
```

Then we want the nodess to be further apart, so we can more easily see what's going one here 

```{r mds set seed}
set.seed(2345)
mds <- layout_with_mds(zach)
igraph::plot.igraph(zach, layout = mds)#ok dit is nog steeds best lelijk eigenlijk, want 33 en 34 zitten op dezelfde plek -- te veel overlap
```

... do something with the coordinates then 

```{r mds layout}
mds
mds[1,1] <- 4
mds[34,1] <--3.5
igraph::plot.igraph(zach, layout = mds)
```

```{r igraph legend}
igraph::plot.igraph(zach, layout = mds, margin = c(0,0,0,0)) 
legend((x = "bottom", c("Note: the position nodes 1 and 34 have been set by Jochem Tolsma (and reproduced by Hannah)\n to be set in a specific position -- and thus do not reflect the properties of the mds algoritm."), bty = "n", cex = .6)
```

# "Twittersphere in the Dutch HoP"

Get some of the X (formerly known as Twitter) info of Members of Parliament, and info about the actors themselves. 
```{r twitter downlaod}
load("twitter_20190919.RData")
str(twitter_20190919, 1)
```

Then extract some info about their characteristics. 

``` {r twitter info}
keyf <- twitter_20190919[[1]] #df on 147 dutch mp's
twitter <- twitter_20190919[[2]] #object we can analyse in RSiena
seats <- twitter_20190919 [[3]] # coordinates of the seats in HoP
fnet <- twitter$depvars$fnet # who follows whom
atmnet <- twitter$depvars$atmnet # who atmentions whom
rtnet <- twitter$depvars$rtnet # who retweats whom
vrouw <- twitter$cCovars$vrouw #gender
partij <- twitter$cCovars$partij #partij
ethminz <- twitter$cCovars$ethminz #ethnic minority
lft <- twitter$cCovars$lft #age 
#de-centralise values 
ethminz <- ethminz + attributes(ethminz)$mean
partij <- partij + attributes(partij)$mean
vrouw <- vrouw + attributes(vrouw)$mean
lft <- lft + attributes(lft)$mean
```

Having extracted and defined the variables of import, we'll now investigate the dataset/structure of the data. 

```{r structure friendship netw}
str(fnet) #the structure of the friendship network
view(fnet)
```

From all these data, we select very specific matrices: friendship (follower) network wave 1, and the "@mentions" for wave 1, 2, and 3 ... 

```{r select matrices}
fnet1 <- fnet[, , 1]  #friendship network wave 1
atmnet1 <- atmnet[, , 1]  #atmention network wave 1
# we will use wave 2 and 3 later.
atmnet2 <- atmnet[, , 2] #atmention network wave 2
atmnet3 <- atmnet[, , 3] #atmention network wave 3
```

... and then, for our last trick, we replace missing values in RSiena 

```{r missing values}
fnet1[fnet == 10] <- 0
atmnet1[atmnet1 == 10] <- 0
atmnet2[atmnet2 == 10] <- 0
atmnet3[atmnet3 == 10] <- 0
```

## The Fun Stuff
Now were gonna do some real fun things, let's begin by making a graph from the atmnet1 information:

```{r keyf}

atmnet1_graph <- igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(atmnet1, mode = "directed", weighted = NULL, diag = T, add.colnames = NA, add.rownames = NA)

atmnet1_edges <- as_data_frame(atmnet1_graph, what = "edges")

keyf <- cbind(keyf$EGOid, keyf[ ,names(keyf) != "EGOid"])

names(keyf)[1] <- "EGOid"

atmnet1_graph <- graph_from_data_frame(atmnet1_edges, directed = T, vertices = keyf)
#now plot!
plot(atmnet1_graph) #all those loners
```

the downsize of the plot we have just ... well ... plotted, is that it is horribly illegible. Let's see if we can introduce some legibiliy to induce some usefulness.

```{r simple plot a}
#first, does [simplify] do anything?
atmnet1_graph <- simplify(atmnet1_graph)
plot(atmnet1_graph) #something happens, nothing useful tho
edge_density(atmnet1_graph) #density of the network does not explain the density of the graph. so we're gonna have to find some other solutions
```

### Directed and reciprocated ties -- a differentiation

```{r graph 2}
atmnet1_un <- atmnet1 == 1 & t(atmnet1) == 1
atmnet1_graph2 <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(atmnet1_un, mode = "undirected", weighted = NULL, diag = T, add.colnames = NA, add.rownames = NA)
edges_atmnet1_un <- as_data_frame(atmnet1_graph2, what = "edges")
atmnet1_graph2 <- graph_from_data_frame(edges_atmnet1_un, directed = F, vertices = keyf)
plot(atmnet1_graph2) # a loopy bitch (self-mention)
atmnet1_graph2 <- simplify(atmnet1_graph2)
plot(atmnet1_graph2, mode = "undirected")
```

### Select Nodes to Plot
```{r select nodes to plot}
#get rid of MP's who only mention themselves
diag(atmnet1_un) <- 0
#find the noisolates (isolate?)
noisolates <- rowSums(atmnet1_un, na.rm = T) > 0
atmnet1_un_sel <- atmnet1_un[noisolates, noisolates]
length(noisolates)
keyf_sel <- keyf[noisolates, ]
atmnet1_graph2_sel <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(atmnet1_un_sel, mode = "undirected", weighted = NULL, diag = T, add.colnames = NA, add.rownames = NA)
atmnet1_graph2_sel <- simplify(atmnet1_graph2_sel)
plot(atmnet1_graph2_sel, mode = "undirected")
```

... or another characteristic -- party (VVD): 

```{r gender or vvd}
# option 1: see above.  only select MPs from the liberal party
selection <- keyf$Partij == "VVD"
# build new adjacency matrix
atmnet1_un_sel2 <- atmnet1_un[selection, selection]
# etc.

# option 2. Suppose we have attached our dataset to our graph object.  only select MPs from the
# liberal party
selection <- V(atmnet1_graph2_sel)$Partij == "VVD"
selection_id <- which(selection)  # this gives us a numeric variable
G_sel <- induced_subgraph(atmnet1_graph2_sel, v = selection_id)
plot(G_sel)
```

... we can also change the size of the vertices ...

```{r change vertix size}
V(atmnet1_graph2_sel)$size <- degree(atmnet1_graph2_sel)*1.3
plot(atmnet1_graph2_sel, mode = "undirected")
```

... or correlate colour and label ...

```{r label colour }
V(atmnet1_graph2)
V(atmnet1_graph2)$label <-  as.character(V(atmnet1_graph2)$Naam2)
V(atmnet1_graph2)$label.cex = 1
V(atmnet1_graph2)$colour <- ifelse(V(atmnet1_graph2)$Geslacht == "vrouw", "red", "blue")
plot(atmnet1_graph2, mode = "undirected")
#or not
```

... curve the edges ...

```{r curvy}
E(atmnet1_graph2)$arrow.size = .4
E(atmnet1_graph2)$curved = .3
plot(atmnet1_graph2, mode = "undirected") #ok i fucked up my edges somewhere along the way i guess
```

... add a legend ...

```{r plot graph2}
plot.igraph(atmnet1_graph2, margin = 0, mode = "udirected")
legend(x = -1, y = -1, c("Female", "Male"), pch = 21, col = "#777777", pt.bg = c("red", "green"), pt.cex = 2,
    cex = 0.8, bty = "n", ncol = 1)
```

# Parliament 

```{r plot with all characteristics}
#knitr::include_graphics("TK.jpg")
plot(keyf$X, keyf$Y, xlim = c(-18, 18), ylim = c(-18, 18), col = keyf$Partij_col, pch = 16)
```

adjust something 

```{r parties}
#give nodes colour to parties
V(atmnet1_graph2)$color <- keyf$Partij_col

# change node size a bit
V(atmnet1_graph2)$size = igraph::degree(atmnet1_graph2) * 1.05 + 6

# remove the labels
V(atmnet1_graph2)$label = ""

# less curvature
E(atmnet1_graph2)$curved = 0.1

owncoords <- cbind(keyf$X, keyf$Y)
owncoords <- owncoords/8
owncoords[, 1] <- (owncoords[, 1] - mean(owncoords[, 1]))
owncoords[, 2] <- (owncoords[, 2] - mean(owncoords[, 2]))
plot.igraph(atmnet1_graph2, mode = "undirected", layout = owncoords, rescale = F, margin = c(0, 0, 0, 0), xlim = c(min(owncoords[,
    1]), max(owncoords[, 1])), ylim = c(min(owncoords[, 2]), max(owncoords[, 2])))
```

... change some edges ... 

```{r edges plaatje}
# construct adjacency matrix first define the recipricated atmentions in each wave
atmnet1_un <- atmnet1 == 1 & t(atmnet1) == 1
atmnet2_un <- atmnet2 == 1 & t(atmnet2) == 1
atmnet3_un <- atmnet3 == 1 & t(atmnet3) == 1

atmnet_weighted <- atmnet1_un + atmnet2_un + atmnet3_un

# contstruct graph / let us keep the loops note that the parameter 'weighted' is set to true.
G_w <- igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(atmnet_weighted, mode = "undirected", weighted = TRUE, diag = TRUE,
    add.colnames = NA, add.rownames = NA)

# attach data
edges <- igraph::as_data_frame(G_w, what = "edges")
# inspect the weight.
edges$weight  #not a lot of variation. 

# rebuild the graph.
G_w <- graph_from_data_frame(edges, directed = FALSE, vertices = keyf)



# add changes as above
V(G_w)$color <- keyf$Partij_col
V(G_w)$size = igraph::degree(G_w) * 1.05 + 6
V(G_w)$label = ""
E(G_w)$curved = 0.1

# add the weights
E(G_w)$width <- E(G_w)$weight

plot.igraph(G_w, mode = "undirected", layout = owncoords, rescale = F, margin = c(0, 0, 0, 0), xlim = c(min(owncoords[,
    1]), max(owncoords[, 1])), ylim = c(min(owncoords[, 2]), max(owncoords[, 2])))
```

... change the edges based on dyads ... 

```{r edges based on dyads}
# let us make them the color of the nodes if it is between nodes from same party.  let us make them
# red if between parties

edges <- as_adjacency_matrix(G_w)
edges_mat <- matrix(as.numeric(edges), nrow = nrow(edges))
# edges_mat

# because we have undirected, we only need the edges once ...I know ...
edges_mat[lower.tri(edges_mat)] <- 0
# table(keyf$Geslacht)

teller <- 1
coloredges <- NA
# we will loop over egos
for (i in 1:nrow(edges)) {
    # We then loop over alters
    for (j in 1:ncol(edges)) {
        # we check if there is a tie between ego and alter
        if (edges_mat[i, j] == 1) {
            # if so, we check ego and alter are from the same party if so, we give the tie the
            # color of the party
            if (keyf$Partij_col[i] == keyf$Partij_col[j]) {
                coloredges[teller] <- keyf$Partij_col[i]
            }
            # if so, we check ego and alter are from the same party if not, we give the tie a
            # transparent grey color
            if (keyf$Partij_col[i] != keyf$Partij_col[j]) {
                coloredges[teller] <- "#0000004B"
